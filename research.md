- Lyman Continuum emission searching in large sample
So far, the number of known Lyman Continuum leakers especially at high redshift is very limited (less than 100). My research interest is to enlarge this sample.......

- Lyman Continuum galaxies physical properties and their mechanism

Finding these galaxies are not enough, we would like to figure out the mechanism of their escaping. Try to connet the z~3 with even higher redshift to explore the reionization.......

- Emission line galaxies at high redshift
HUnting for emission line galaxies with powerful space telescopes.....

- JWST NIRISS data reduction (processing...)
    description: JWST NIRISS data reduction pipeline optimizing.....

Here are the detailed introduction of my research interests. Some of them are just at the beginning stage. I am happy to discuss and always ready to learn new things!

# Emission line galaxies at high redshift
HUnting for emission line galaxies with powerful space telescopes.....

# JWST NIRISS data reduction (processing...)
JWST NIRISS data reduction pipeline optimizing.....

Here are the detailed introduction of my research interests. Some of them are just at the beginning stage. I am happy to discuss and always ready to learn new things!
